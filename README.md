## Description 

This project was built for a company to use for generating a secure password. The generator takes in user inputs to determine how complex to make the password. Inputs taken in are
as follows: length of password, if the user wants lowercase characters, uppercase, numbers or special characters. It will then generate a password matching this criteria and output to the text area. I also added in an option for copy to clipboard to make sure they don't misspell the password given. I have also removed certain characters to clear up any confusion. Things like a lowercase 'l', an uppercase 'I', as well as the pipe '|' since these can be confusing with certain fonts. Also the uppercase letter 'O' has been removed.

## Credits

Credits go to W3 schools for clearing up any JavaScript questions I had
