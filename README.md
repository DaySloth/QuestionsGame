## Description 

This project was built as a simple 5 questions game. The app utilizes local storage and JavaScript to dynamically update the HTML elements on the page. The highscores will be locally saved and updated after every quiz attempt.

## Testing

There are explainations on the landing page. You have 60 seconds to complete the quiz. There is no winning score, try to get as many correct as possible, then input your name and save your high score. You can view your highscores by selecting the highscores links. If you answer a question wrong you will be deducted 10 seconds off the clock so be careful.

## Credits

Credits go to W3 schools for clearing up any JavaScript questions I had
